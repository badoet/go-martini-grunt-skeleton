# go-martini-grunt-skeleton

> A skeleton Martini-based Golang web project using [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) for asset management.


## Why fork

Forked from caroussel beautiful grunt skeleton for martini app

Customized for golang app running on the following structure:
- Goji (sorry martini) EDIT : i think martini will still run on this.
- Bootstrap Less : i just like to handle less than css
- Single page application front end (angular/ember/vue/etc) : just need html as is, no need tmpl

The orginal from Caroussel dont works so well with bootstrap less
and its abit outdated. i only need to tweak a few stuff to get it to where i want it to be.



see the original for more info

do note some folder structure is changed to suit my need.
